## Extended TicTacToe
This program modifies the well known TicTacToe game by implementing a 5x5 board instead of a 3x3 board.The GUI was made using JavFX.   

The user/users will interact with the GUI by clicking on one of the grid squares, which will place either an X or O in that grid square.  
If either the X or the O gets 5 in a row, the player assigned that shape will win the game. The 5 in a row can be vertical, horizonal, or diagonal.  
If all the grid squares are taken by an X or an O without any winners, the game is a draw.  
Once the game has been won, no more X's or O's can be placed.  

The bottom of the GUI window will give updates on the state of the game, indicating whether it is X's turn, O'x turn, whether someone has won the game, or whether the game ended in a draw.
